<h2>Hello dear reader!</h2>

<p>This repository contains files for automated testing in Python using the <em>pytest</em> framework using the test <em>Page Object</em> pattern.
<br>
<p>Development of autotests using the Selenium WebDriver</p>
<br>
The Page Object Design Pattern provides the following advantages:
<ul>
<li style="list-style: decimal">There is a clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators and layout.
<li style="list-style: decimal">There is a single repository for the services or operations offered by the page rather than having these services scattered throughout the tests.
</ul>
<br>
The repository contains Python files, which contain test cases:
<b>
<ul> 
<li style="list-style: circle">Registration / Authorization
<li style="list-style: circle">Shopping
<li style="list-style: circle">Linking between pages
<li style="list-style: circle">Determine the functionality of the site basket
<li style="list-style: circle">Purchases of goods by guests and authorized users</b>
</ul>

<p>Run this command:</p>
<em><b>pytest -v --tb=line --language=en -m need_review</em></b>
<br>or<br>
<p>Run this command to run all tests in the directory:</p>
<em><b>pytest -v --tb=line --language=en TestAddingToBasket/</em></b>
